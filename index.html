              <p class="card-text"><p>Web development is one of the fastest growing technology careers in the industry. <strong>Knowing how to code a website opens up several job opportunities for a career in technology</strong>. It requires an understanding of various coding languages, design workflows, and more. If you want to learn how to code a website and you&rsquo;re a complete beginner, then check out our comprehensive guide below on coding a website from scratch.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; float: left; margin: 3px 4px 3px 4px;" src="https://images.websitebuilderexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Coding-for-Beginners-Best-Way-to-Learn-HTML-CSS-Codes-to-Build-a-Website.png" alt="coding for beginners" width="285" height="330" />After you have a basic understanding of html and its individual elements its time to take the next step with some simple projects and apply your coding knowledge to solve challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Website builders vs. coding a website from scratch</h3>
<p>In the early days of the Internet, building a website used to be difficult. That&rsquo;s because <strong>developers had to code a website from scratch, which would take hours if not weeks</strong>s. Business owners had no choice but to pay thousands of dollars to have someone build/code a website. Even when website builders were introduced, many businesses preferred to hire professional programmers to build their websites because those tools simply couldn&rsquo;t offer the same quality.</p>
<h3>Wordpress &amp; CMS website builders</h3>
<p>One thing <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wordpress</a> is known for is its vast selection of plugins. Because <strong>it is open source and one of the most popular website builders available</strong>, many plugins have been created just for it. A plugin is simply a small piece of software that allows you to add a group of unique functions to your wordpress website. Think of it as a "do it for you" code that allows you to do more.</p>
<p>A content management system, also known as a cms, is less flexible if you build things from scratch, which means you have less control over your front-end. However, a cms is easier to use (you have to write less code), and often has tools to host the site, store user information, create a blog, publish landing pages, capture leads, and even build an email list. As a result,<em>you&rsquo;ll be able to make your site more profitable with less than half the work.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe class="youtube-player" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3JluqTojuME" width="604" height="340" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Most websites (particularly content-based ones) built on wordpress have social sharing buttons that allow users to share content on various social media platforms.</strong> However, for static sites that are&rsquo;t based on wordpress, adding social sharing buttons is a challenge. Social media sharing is a grat way to let others syndicate and share your content - this is something that helps you with search engine optimization SEO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEO alows you to rank inside of the search engines for your keywords. As long as your ranking for the right keywords visitors that come to your website will be highly targeted. this is why many like to hire coders that understand SEO because website design and seo go hand in hand. If at the very least then one should know their keywords while they code their site. You can find more on keyword research and seo by visiting <a href="http://www.abbasravji.com/reviews/products/Ubersuggest-Review-2022,-The-Pros-cons.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this website</a></p>
<p>All easy website creation tools are actually limited. They offer you a set of themes and plugins that are very easy for beginners to use &ndash; as long as you don&rsquo;t need to modify them. When you do need to modify a theme or do something more custom with your website, however, you will need at least a basic understanding of web development code. As an example, <strong>with a little javascript knowledge, you can integrate almost any social media feed into your website!</strong>.</p>
<p>a massive portion of the Internet uses php. Even the world's largest website builders, wordpress, use php features. php is an open source web programming language. php uses your server so it&amp;rsqu;s faster than jsp and asp has an easy to understand syntax php is platform independent, so the code is easily executable on every os.</p></p>

              <h2 class="card-title"><a href="./Coding/Build-Optimized-Websites-with-HTMl-and-CSS.html">Build Optimized Websites with HTMl and CSS</a></h2>
              <p class="card-text"><p>In this article you will learn the basic ways to use HTML and CSS to design a static website that is optimized for Search Engine Rank. Static means fixed html website that is not powered by any database.</p>
<h2>Why is it important to code well?</h2>
<p>Precision is important when writing html. Even an extra space or a misspelled character can prevent your code from working as expected. <strong>If your html code is not rendering in the browser as intended, make sure you have written the code exactly as it should be.</strong> To troubleshoot errors, check for extra or missing spaces, missing or misspelled tags, and missing or incorrect punctuation or characters. Each time you change your code, be sure to save your file before reloading it into your browser to check your results.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="https://henryegloff.com/media/How-to-Code-a-Basic-Webpage-Using-HTML-Tutorial-2.jpg" alt="html web design" width="760" height="523" /></p>
<p>HTML &amp; css code tells the browser what kind of content is contained on the website and how it should be displayed. It consists of <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/html-tags-for-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">html tags</a> that tell the browser where the html code begins and where it ends.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Another important aspect of web development is ensuring that the site displays and functions the same way in all browsers.</span> For example, testing an interactive order form only in firefox might mean that hitting &ldquo;submit order&rdquo; causes the site to behave differently in chrome or microsoft edge. With this need in mind, google&rsquo;s chrome development tools were created. This plugin allows programmers to edit code and web pages in real time. Changes that are made in html, css, or javascript are all viewable in real time. This means no more running code, looking for errors, and then going back to the code editor to find out where things went wrong.</p>
<p>It's also very important you keep search engines in mind too. <strong>The last thing you want is a very nicely coded website that does not attract visitors to it.</strong> In order to attract visitors to your sites then you have a couple of options. One is a paid for option by buying Ads such as facebook or Google PPC ads. Another option is free but takes a little longer. Its called Search engine optimization. You can read more about this on the following url&nbsp;<a href="http://www.abbasravji.com/reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.abbasravji.com/reviews/</a></p>
<h3>What are the different types of code?</h3>
<p>The code to learn will largely depend on the industry you want to work in. For example, if you want to work on mobile applications, you'll want to learn java, kotlin, and swift. If you want to work in games, you'll need c++ and unreal engine and/or c# with unity engine. You'll want to learn the c language for operating systems, and for websites you'll want javascript or typescript for front-end, python or ruby for back-end.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe class="youtube-player" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qz0aGYrrlhU" width="604" height="340" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Coding is one of the few skills that comes at absolutely no cost if you make a mistake</strong>. If you&rsquo;re learning to cook or paint and have a failed final product, those are resources spent that you can&rsquo;t recover. But if you&rsquo;ve messed with a segment of code, just delete it and never look back.</p>
<p>Most people prefer to learn online rather than going to an institution because it saves time and you can learn anywhere. There are many ways to learn to code and best of all its fun.</p></p>
