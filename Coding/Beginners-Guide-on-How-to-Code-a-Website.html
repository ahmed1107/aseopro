		  <p>Web development is one of the fastest growing technology careers in the industry. <strong>Knowing how to code a website opens up several job opportunities for a career in technology</strong>. It requires an understanding of various coding languages, design workflows, and more. If you want to learn how to code a website and you&rsquo;re a complete beginner, then check out our comprehensive guide below on coding a website from scratch.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; float: left; margin: 3px 4px 3px 4px;" src="https://images.websitebuilderexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Coding-for-Beginners-Best-Way-to-Learn-HTML-CSS-Codes-to-Build-a-Website.png" alt="coding for beginners" width="285" height="330" />After you have a basic understanding of html and its individual elements its time to take the next step with some simple projects and apply your coding knowledge to solve challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Website builders vs. coding a website from scratch</h3>
<p>In the early days of the Internet, building a website used to be difficult. That&rsquo;s because <strong>developers had to code a website from scratch, which would take hours if not weeks</strong>s. Business owners had no choice but to pay thousands of dollars to have someone build/code a website. Even when website builders were introduced, many businesses preferred to hire professional programmers to build their websites because those tools simply couldn&rsquo;t offer the same quality.</p>
<h3>Wordpress &amp; CMS website builders</h3>
<p>One thing <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wordpress</a> is known for is its vast selection of plugins. Because <strong>it is open source and one of the most popular website builders available</strong>, many plugins have been created just for it. A plugin is simply a small piece of software that allows you to add a group of unique functions to your wordpress website. Think of it as a "do it for you" code that allows you to do more.</p>
<p>A content management system, also known as a cms, is less flexible if you build things from scratch, which means you have less control over your front-end. However, a cms is easier to use (you have to write less code), and often has tools to host the site, store user information, create a blog, publish landing pages, capture leads, and even build an email list. As a result,<em>you&rsquo;ll be able to make your site more profitable with less than half the work.</em></p>

<p><strong>Most websites (particularly content-based ones) built on wordpress have social sharing buttons that allow users to share content on various social media platforms.</strong> However, for static sites that are&rsquo;t based on wordpress, adding social sharing buttons is a challenge. Social media sharing is a grat way to let others syndicate and share your content - this is something that helps you with search engine optimization SEO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEO alows you to rank inside of the search engines for your keywords. As long as your ranking for the right keywords visitors that come to your website will be highly targeted. this is why many like to hire coders that understand SEO because website design and seo go hand in hand. If at the very least then one should know their keywords while they code their site. You can find more on keyword research and seo by visiting <a href="http://www.abbasravji.com/reviews/products/Ubersuggest-Review-2022,-The-Pros-cons.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this website</a></p>
<p>All easy website creation tools are actually limited. They offer you a set of themes and plugins that are very easy for beginners to use &ndash; as long as you don&rsquo;t need to modify them. When you do need to modify a theme or do something more custom with your website, however, you will need at least a basic understanding of web development code. As an example, <strong>with a little javascript knowledge, you can integrate almost any social media feed into your website!</strong>.</p>
<p>a massive portion of the Internet uses php. Even the world's largest website builders, wordpress, use php features. php is an open source web programming language. php uses your server so it&amp;rsqu;s faster than jsp and asp has an easy to understand syntax php is platform independent, so the code is easily executable on every os.</p>
